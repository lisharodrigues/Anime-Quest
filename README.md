# Anime Quest

This is a web application built to allow users to organize, categorize, and track their favorite anime shows for personal viewing. The app integrates a seamless user interface and backend functionality, leveraging key technologies like **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**.

## Overview

The Anime Tracker Web Application allows users to:
- **Categorize anime** into different lists (e.g., Watching, Completed, Planned, Dropped).
- **Track progress** on anime they are currently watching.
- **Rate and review anime** for better personal recommendations.
  
This project helped enhance my skills in **web application development** and **database management**, giving me hands-on experience working with essential technologies in a real-world scenario.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration with **Spring Security**.
- **Anime Categorization**: Users can add anime to specific categories (watching, completed, on-hold, etc.).
- **REST API Integration**: Fetch up-to-date anime data via external APIs.
- **Database Management**: Uses **MySQL** to store user and anime information securely.

## Technology Stack

- **Java**: Core language for the backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building and running the application.
- **Spring Security**: Ensures safe and secure user authentication and authorization.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing user data and anime records.
- **REST API**: Integration of external APIs to fetch real-time anime information.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, and **REST API** integration.
- Improved understanding of **web application development** and backend architecture.
- Strengthened knowledge of **database management** using **MySQL**.
